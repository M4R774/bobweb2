"""
Message board can have three types of message:s notifications, events and scheduled messages.

Notifications: short messages that are shown for a given short duration.
If multiple notifications are queued, they are shown in order one by one. 
Notification always overrides events and scheduled messages.

Events: messages with some state that are triggered by some action or event in the chat. 
For example if user links a video stream, that might start an event that shows
the streams online-status until it goes offline. Overrides scheduled messages. Events end on predefined
condition or on another action in the chat.

Scheduled messages: content that has been scheduled beforehand with a set timetable, like television scheduling.
For example if weather info is shown each morning on a set time period between 8:00-9:00.
